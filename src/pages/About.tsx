          <p>Adam has been a Gold Coast local for over 40 years and has spent his entire career in the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>
            He became a dealer principal and shareholder of his own dealership and has represented
            major manufacturers including Toyota, Ford, Holden, Honda, Mitsubishi, KIA, and Suzuki,
            to name a few.
          </p>
          <p>In 2010, Adam was invited to present a live radio show called <em>What&rsquo;s Your Car Worth</em> on 89.3 4CRB FM.</p>
          <p>From day one, the show was well received by the local community.</p>
          <p>To date, Adam has provided over 10,000 car valuations to residents of the Gold Coast and surrounding area residents.</p>
          <p>Amazingly, these were all live on air.</p>
          <p>His segment is often said to be the fastest 30 minutes in radio; there is always a high volume of callers, keen to seek Adam&rsquo;s advice.</p>
          <p>Adam insists on providing open and transparent information to listeners.</p>
          <p>It is typical of his approach generally, without all the fuss normally associated with buying and selling cars.</p>
          <p>
            After listening to and speaking with thousands of callers over the years live on air,
            Adam discovered that many people just wanted a simple solution to selling their car that
            avoids the pitfalls, the &lsquo;tyre kickers&rsquo; and the hassle of selling privately
            or trading it in through a dealership.
          </p>
          <p>Adam spent a lot of time thinking about this feedback and decided to create a car buying service for the local community that was:</p>
          <ul className="about-bio__list">
            <li>Stress-free</li>
            <li>Convenient</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>Safe</li>
            <li>Super fast (you can receive payment the same day, though we usually allow 24 hours)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hundreds of customers have sold their car to Adam, and the positive feedback continues to be outstanding.</p>
          <p>Adam is incredibly grateful for the community support for this new business.</p>
          <p className="about-bio__from">From Adam:</p>
          <blockquote className="about-bio__quote">
            &ldquo;I am incredibly grateful for the community support for my new business and look
            forward to assisting many more people in the future.&rdquo;
